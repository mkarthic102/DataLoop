1) Meghana Karthic - mkarthi2

2) DataLoop.cpp and TDataLoop.inc contain the implementation of
functions declared in DataLoop.h and TDataLoop.h, respectively. 
DataLoop.cpp and TDataLoop.inc contain a default constructor,
a non-default constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor, 
overloaded operator functions, and a clear function. The clear 
function is the only function that didn't have a declaration 
in the starter code. I invoked clear() in my destructor and in
the operator=() and splice() functions to empty a DataLoop.

3) I used the overloaded operator functions I created when writing
other overloaded operator functions. For example, in splice(), I
used the overloaded assignment operator and in operator+(), I used
the overloaded operator+=() function.

4) Not applicable.
